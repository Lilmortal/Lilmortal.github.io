        <q>These are some of the best logos I have ever seen. The minimalistic layout and it's use of colours are some examples of what a modern logo should look like. It is able to capture the audience attention and imagination in a quick period of time - resulting in an increase in sales and revenue. 5/5 - Mormon Freeman, CEO of BigBoi Ltd</q>
        <q>Gangsta as logo - Snoop Salmon, Philosopher</q>
        <q>Shieeeeeet, our supreme leader decided to use that third logo to be our country's new flag - Park Wu Song , Foreign ambassador of North Korea</q>
