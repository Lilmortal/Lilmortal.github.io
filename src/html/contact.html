            <q>These are some of the best logos I have ever seen. The minimalistic layout and it's use of colours are some examples of what a modern logo should look like. It is able to capture the audience attention and imagination in a quick period of time - resulting in an increase in sales and revenue. 5/5 - Mormon Freeman</q>

            <q>Our supreme leader decided this man has the perfect skill needed to create his country's new logo - Park Wu Song (Foreign ambassador of North Korea)</q>
            <q>Very nice, much much perfect. This website is awesome too; after playing it I realized I suck at dota and I decided that all my dota 2 items are much better in Jack's hands. - Dennis Lee,
